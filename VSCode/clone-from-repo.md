# Clone from repo

When opening VSCode, it presents the option to clone from a repo.

This presents a nicer (in practice and mental taxation of remembering how) workflow than what I'm used to doing.

Previous:

Create a repo on github -> git clone -> set origin ..etc

Now:

Create a repo -> open VSCode -> clone from repo.
